# customer_behavior_analysis
data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python, sql, and power BI

Overview
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on transforming raw data into actionable business insights. The workflow covers the entire data pipeline—from initial ingestion and cleaning in Python, to deep-dive relational querying in PostgreSQL, and finally to visual storytelling through Power BI and Gamma.

The goal of this project is to [mention your goal, e.g., identify customer churn patterns / optimize sales performance] to support data-driven decision-making.

Dataset
Source: Youtube Amlan Mohanty

Description: The dataset contains 3900 records and 18 features, including  Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status), Purchase details (Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color), Shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Previous Purchases, Frequency of 
Purchases, Review Rating, Shipping Type) 

Format: .csv 

Tools & Technologies
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Database: PostgreSQL (Data modeling and complex querying)

Visualization: Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)

Reporting: Gamma (AI-powered presentation decks)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Project Steps
1. Data Ingestion & EDA (Python)
Loaded the raw dataset using Pandas.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Visualized data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values and removed duplicate records.

Standardized data formats (e.g., Date-Time objects).

Exported the cleaned dataset for database migration.

3. Relational Database Management (SQL)
Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Wrote optimized SQL queries to perform:

Revenue by Gender – Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.
High-Spending Discount Users – Identified customers who used discounts but still spent above the average purchase amount. 
Top 5 Products by Rating – Found products with the highest average review ratings. 
Shipping Type Comparison – Compared average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping.
Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers – Compared average spend and total revenue across subscription status. 
Discount-Dependent Products – Identified 5 products with the highest percentage of discounted purchases. 
Customer Segmentation – Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal segments based on purchase history. 
Top 3 Products per Category – Listed the most purchased products within each category. 
Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions – Checked whether customers with >5 purchases are more likely to subscribe. 
Revenue by Age Group – Calculated total revenue contribution of each age group. 

4. Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
Connected Power BI to the PostgreSQL database.

Developed a multi-page dashboard featuring:

KPI Cards: Total Sales, Growth %, etc.

Trend Analysis: Time-series charts.

Filters/Slicers: Region, Category, and Date range.

5. Presentation & Reporting
Compiled findings into a comprehensive project report.

Used Gamma to generate a professional, high-impact presentation deck for stakeholders.
